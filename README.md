Tumor Cellular Automata model for simulating three types of cancer therapy: radiotherapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

The proposed model follows some of the ideas described in the following works:

It however extends them, adding among other elements a simulation of the diffusion of a nutrient. Concentration of such nutrient determines necrosis of cells and effectiveness
of some of the therapies within the model.
